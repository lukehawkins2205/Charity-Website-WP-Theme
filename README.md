# Charity Website (Custom Wordpress Theme)

Hi! This is a website that I developed for a local charity. They needed an online presence but also required a central repository for members to keep up to date with the latest news from their charity. The perfect solution for this was to build a website with a CMS attached to it. 

> This is a clone repository of the live repository that I use for [Twynham Lodge 5889](https://twynhamlodge5889.co.uk/).

## **Sign up form**
The contents of the form is sent to the designated email address via SMTP to handle.

## **Compatible across all browsers**
This was possible by using **Babel**
## **Mobile Compatible**
CSS framework **Bootstrap 4** was used to structure the website so that it can be dynamic across all devices with ease.
## **Custom Post Types**
**Posts** with **date**, **location** and **time** properties. This allows for 'Event Posts'

## **Custom Comments**
The charity required a guest book for other charities to comment on. From this information, I created **filter hooks** to modify the **comment form defaults** which displays approved comments on the guest page.
